# Crop Prediction System

This project is a **Crop Prediction System** that predicts the best crop to grow based on weather and soil conditions. It uses machine learning models to predict the most suitable crop based on the following features:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH Level
- Rainfall
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: The system uses a Random Forest model for crop prediction.
- **Data Input**: Users provide data such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels.
- **Model Output**: The system predicts the best crop to grow based on the input data.
- **Web Application**: The app is built using Flask and is deployed to Azure for easy access.

## Prerequisites

To run the system locally, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (for managing Python packages)
- Git (for version control)
- Azure account (if deploying to Azure)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishna80/CropPredictionApp.git
cd CropPredictionApp
